# Deviant DBS

A distributed scraping service that checks if any artists in the DeviantCord Postgres database have posted anything new via the DeviantArt API and creates the necessary notifications for the Discord Bot to send. It will intelligently track which discord servers have received the notification. 

This is currently a preview of it. Not the official version.
